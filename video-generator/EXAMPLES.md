## Tips for Writing Better Scripts

1. **Keep it concise** - Aim for 1-3 minutes of speaking time (100-300 words)
2. **Use clear language** - Avoid jargon, use simple everyday words
3. **Tell a story** - Start with a problem, show the solution, end with a call-to-action
4. **Include benefits** - Focus on what customers gain, not just features
5. **Add personality** - Write like you're talking to a friend, not reading from a manual
6. **Break into sections** - Use paragraphs to divide your script into logical chunks
7. **Include a call-to-action** - End with what you want viewers to do next

## Best Practices

- **Tutorial videos**: Step-by-step, show one feature at a time
- **Presentations**: Use storytelling to engage viewers
- **Demos**: Show real usage, not just features

## Social Media Tips

After generating your video:

**For Instagram/TikTok**:
- Trim to 15-60 seconds

- Use trending music
- Post during peak hours (9am-10pm)

**For YouTube**:
- Keep full length (2-5 minutes)
- Add detailed description with links
- Include relevant keywords in title
- Create custom thumbnails

**For Facebook**:
- Auto-play with captions
- Shorter videos perform better (1-2 minutes)
- Engage in comments to boost reach
